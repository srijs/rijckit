Still in early development.","body":"### What's that? An icelandic delicacy?\r\n\r\nQuite, quite, my friend. When Rijckit is grown up, it wants to be a analysis-tool for the C family of languages.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it can already lex a bunch of C, with more (preprocessor, parser) soon to follow.\r\nRijckit is open source, so you can verify that it is indeed lovely handcrafted and – if you wish – contribute some of your spare time to it, just like I like to do.\r\n\r\n### That sounds nice. What does it do exactly, so far?\r\n\r\nRijckit works (so far I can tell – unit test are another thing to follow) already quite well. It lexes many C programs completely, including, but not interpreting, preprocessor statements. But unfortunately it is very simple-minded with numbers – just decimal digits will work for now."}
